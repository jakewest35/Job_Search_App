# Job_search_app

This is a side project that I created to help with my search for a full-time job after graduation. The tool pings the LinkedIn and Indeed API's made available through the free tier on rapidAPI and displays the first page of results. In future versions of this project I plan to implement pagination and explore filtering options if any are available through the API's.
